# A Contact Book

This is a simple contact book which uses React JS, Material UI and a Axios to read all the data and displays it on the screen.

The application is composed of the following Features:

* The application reads data consisting of avatar, name, phone no., email id and university from the API using Axios.
* Now the application sorts the contacts on the basis of the name and displays it.
* The application also allows you to mark a contact as your favourite. The favourites are displayed at the top of the page.
